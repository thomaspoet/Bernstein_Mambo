# Leonhard Bernstein: "Mambo" from West Side Story

Segments from Mambo for section violin 1 for training were cut out of the work and midi files in various tempi (80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 132(original)) were created accordingly.

The files: Mambo_80bpm.midi, Mambo_90bpm.midi, Mambo_100bpm.midi, Mambo_110bpm.midi, Mambo_120bpm.midi contain no music, only the beats in given tempo.
